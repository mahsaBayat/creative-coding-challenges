----------
## Flow:

* Flow is a static type checker for JavaScript.
* Visit [Why I chose to use Flow for static type checking my JavaScript?](https://www.lullabot.com/articles/flow-for-static-type-checking-javascript) to better understand the need for a static type checker, especially Flow.
* This boiler plate already comes with ```flow``` installed.
* In order to use Flow while coding, ```// @flow``` must be added at the top of the file. You can read more about it here. [Getting Started](https://flow.org/en/docs/getting-started/)

## ESLint:

* ESLint is a JavaScript linting utility. Linting tools allow developers to find problems with their JavaScript code without executing it. This is especially useful because JavaScript is a dynamic and loosely-typed langauge and very prone to developer errors. Visit [ESLint](https://eslint.org/docs/about/) to read more about it.
* This boiler plate already comes with ```eslint``` installed.

## Prettier:

* Prettier is an opinionated code formatter. 
* It removes all original styling and ensures that outputted code conforms to a consistent style. This comes in very handy in group projects, where each developer might have a different coding style.
* Visit [What is Prettier?](https://prettier.io/docs/en/index.html) to read more about it.
* This boiler plate already comes with ```prettier``` installed.
* You must also add Prettier to your preferred code editor. 

## Storybook:

* Storybook is a development environment for UI components.
* It runs outside of your app. This allows you to develop UI components in isolation, which can improve component reuse, testability, and development speed. You can build quickly without having to worry about application-specific dependencies. (HOW GREAT IS THIS?)
* Visit [Storybook Github](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook) to read more about it.
* This boiler plate already comes with storybooks.
